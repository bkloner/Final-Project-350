# Final-Project-350

For our Machine Learning algorithm, we will be using Polly and Transcribe to go from text input to voice output, and then back from voice input to text output. 
Our idea was brought upon as some words (or names!) have weird pronunciations or spellings that might impact how they are said by Polly or heard by Transcribe. 
Through Polly, we will be using the different voice IDs in Polly to see if the accent plays a role in the accuracy of the transcriber and explore the variable of the origin of words. 
We suspect that those hidden variables might have a significant impact on the accuracy of the algorithms. 

We will map out how to create a bucket in AWS S3, and then from there how we used S3 to transform and interpret the data. Also, we will have an overview of the architecture like the one in the blog post.
